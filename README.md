Target detection using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar has recently gained popularity in
radar research due to its ability to mitigate the target radar cross-section fading and substantial spatial
diversity gain. Recently, an optimal MIMO radar detector, including optimal transmit and receive
weightage, has been proposed for the detection of steady targets. A moving target differs the scenario
from a steady target case due to its Doppler. Hence, the optimal detector of a steady target case does
not work for the case of a moving target. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a MIMO radar detector
for the context of moving targets, including optimal transmit and receive weight schemes. For
obtaining the proposed detector, knowledge about the target fading that can be applied to a moving
target scenario is a prerequisite. Therefore, we proposed to use a training mechanism in which a few
transmit pulses are introduced once in every coherent processing interval, and the corresponding target
returns are used to estimate the target fading. However, in a moving target scenario, the target returns
are Doppler-steered versions of the target fading. Therefore, it is proposed to compensate the Doppler
for target fading estimation by matching a steering vector to the target returns. This type of use of
online estimation of the target fading characteristics and applying it for moving target detection is the
first of its kind in radar research. The proposed radar is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art MIMO
radars addressed in the literature.
